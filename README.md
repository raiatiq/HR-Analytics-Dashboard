# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
🚀 My First Step into Data Visualization with Power BI!
I’m excited to share my very first HR Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI. 📊✨

This project visualizes key HR metrics such as:

Attrition analysis by age, salary, education, and gender

Department-wise employee distribution

Average salary, age, and years of experience

Job role breakdown


✅ Total Employees: 43
✅ Avg Salary: 5574
✅ Zero Attrition – a positive insight!

This hands-on experience helped me understand the power of data-driven decisions in HR and business intelligence.

💡 Tools Used: Power BI
🎯 Goal: Convert raw HR data into actionable insights

🔍 Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
