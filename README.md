# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
ðŸš€ My First Step into Data Visualization with Power BI!
Iâ€™m excited to share my very first HR Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI. ðŸ“Šâœ¨

This project visualizes key HR metrics such as:

Attrition analysis by age, salary, education, and gender

Department-wise employee distribution

Average salary, age, and years of experience

Job role breakdown


âœ… Total Employees: 43
âœ… Avg Salary: 5574
âœ… Zero Attrition â€“ a positive insight!

This hands-on experience helped me understand the power of data-driven decisions in HR and business intelligence.

ðŸ’¡ Tools Used: Power BI
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Convert raw HR data into actionable insights
